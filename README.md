# AuthZ Scanner

AuthZ Scanner is a **config-driven REST API authorization security testing tool** built with Python.

The project is designed to test common authorization vulnerabilities across REST APIs and compare the behavior of intentionally vulnerable and hardened implementations.

It consists of two main components:

- A demo API laboratory containing vulnerable and hardened FastAPI applications
- A reusable authorization scanner that performs HTTP-based security tests using YAML configuration files

The primary goal is to demonstrate how the same scanner behaves against two implementations of the same API:

```text
Vulnerable API  -> authorization findings detected
Hardened API    -> no findings expected for the same test cases
```

---

## Security Coverage

AuthZ Scanner currently evaluates the following vulnerability classes:

- **BOLA** — Broken Object Level Authorization
- **BFLA** — Broken Function Level Authorization
- **Excessive Data Exposure**
- **Mass Assignment**
- **Privilege Escalation**

These behaviors are intentionally implemented in two different demo environments:

- `apps/vulnerable_api` — intentionally insecure API used to demonstrate authorization vulnerabilities
- `apps/hardened_api` — secured implementation of the same API behavior

The scanner itself does not contain hardcoded target endpoints.

Target URLs, authentication details, user identities, object identifiers, and test rules are defined through YAML configuration files under `config/`.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tayfunozgur13/authz-scanner.git
cd authz-scanner
```

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate it:

### macOS / Linux

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Windows

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The project uses a standard Python repository structure and can be opened with editors such as VS Code, Cursor, or PyCharm.

---

## Running the Demo APIs

Start the intentionally vulnerable API:

```bash
uvicorn apps.vulnerable_api.main:app --reload --port 8001
```

Start the hardened API:

```bash
uvicorn apps.hardened_api.main:app --reload --port 8002
```

Both APIs should be running when performing a comparative scan.

### Health Endpoints

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8001/health
http://127.0.0.1:8002/health
```

### OpenAPI Documents

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8001/openapi.json
http://127.0.0.1:8002/openapi.json
```

---

## Demo Identities

Demo users are automatically seeded when the APIs start.

| Identity | Email | Password | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| userA | `userA@example.com` | `Password123!` | `user` |
| userB | `userB@example.com` | `Password123!` | `user` |
| admin1 | `admin1@example.com` | `Password123!` | `admin` |

These credentials are used **only for the local intentionally vulnerable/hardened demo environment**.

The seed data uses fixed UUID values to keep object references consistent across scans and reports.

---

## Scanner Usage

### Scan the Vulnerable API

```bash
python -m scanner.main --config config/vulnerable.yaml
```

### Scan the Hardened API

```bash
python -m scanner.main --config config/hardened.yaml
```

### Generate JSON Report

```bash
python -m scanner.main \
  --config config/vulnerable.yaml \
  --report-format json
```

### Generate Markdown Pentest Report

```bash
python -m scanner.main \
  --config config/vulnerable.yaml \
  --report-format markdown
```

### Generate Both Formats

```bash
python -m scanner.main \
  --config config/vulnerable.yaml \
  --report-format all
```

### Compare Vulnerable and Hardened Targets

```bash
python -m scanner.main \
  --compare-config config/vulnerable.yaml config/hardened.yaml
```

Expected demo behavior:

```text
vulnerable: 13 findings
hardened: 0 findings
```

The exact number of findings depends on the current scanner configuration and demo implementation.

---

## How Authorization Testing Works

Authorization testing requires multiple identities and expected access-control rules.

For example, a simplified BOLA test may follow this logic:

```text
1. Authenticate as User A
2. Access User A's resource
3. Store the resource identifier
4. Authenticate as User B
5. Attempt to access User A's resource
6. Evaluate the HTTP response and returned data
7. Generate a finding if unauthorized access succeeds
```

This approach allows the scanner to evaluate actual authorization behavior rather than relying only on static endpoint definitions.

---

## BOLA Detection

BOLA tests evaluate whether one authenticated user can access objects belonging to another user.

Example:

```text
User A -> GET /orders/USER_A_ORDER_ID -> 200 OK
User B -> GET /orders/USER_A_ORDER_ID -> 200 OK
```

If User B receives User A's protected object without proper authorization, the scanner generates a BOLA finding.

---

## BFLA Detection

BFLA tests evaluate whether lower-privileged users can invoke privileged API functions.

Example:

```text
Regular User -> POST /admin/users
```

If an endpoint intended only for administrators can be successfully accessed by a normal user, the scanner records a BFLA finding.

---

## Property Authorization Testing

The property authorization module evaluates issues such as:

- Mass Assignment
- Excessive Data Exposure
- Privilege Escalation

Example privilege escalation attempt:

```json
{
  "name": "User A",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

If an ordinary user can modify a protected property such as `role`, the scanner generates a security finding.

---

## Reporting

AuthZ Scanner supports two report formats.

### JSON

Designed for automated processing and integrations.

Possible future uses include:

- CI/CD pipelines
- security dashboards
- vulnerability management systems
- automated post-processing

### Markdown

Designed as a human-readable penetration testing report.

The Markdown report includes:

- Executive Summary
- Scan Metadata
- Tested Identities
- Findings Summary
- Detailed Findings
- Evidence Appendix

Each finding can contain:

- Severity
- Vulnerability class
- OWASP API category
- Affected endpoint
- Impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Evidence summary
- Remediation guidance

---

## Sensitive Data Redaction

The reporting layer automatically masks sensitive values.

Examples include:

```text
password
password_hash
token
refresh_token
api_key
secret
ssn
card information
```

Sensitive values are replaced with:

```text
[REDACTED]
```

This reduces the risk of exposing credentials or sensitive application data inside generated reports.

---

## Report Management

Generated reports are stored locally under:

```text
reports/
```

The directory is intended for local scan output and is not committed to the repository.

Each reporting run updates:

```text
reports/manifest.json
```

Convenience files are also generated:

```text
reports/latest.json
reports/latest.md
```

These provide quick access to the most recent scan results.

---

## Resetting Demo Data

Some scanner modules intentionally perform mutation-based authorization tests.

For example:

- a privilege escalation test may temporarily change `userA` from `user` to `admin`
- a mass assignment test may create or modify an object
- authorization tests may modify application state

Reset the demo environment with:

```bash
python -m apps.reset_demo_data
```

Expected output:

```text
Reset demo data for: vulnerable, hardened
```

The reset operation belongs to the demo API environment rather than the scanner itself.

The scanner performs tests but does not automatically manage target application state outside explicitly defined test actions.

---

## Error Handling

Common runtime failures are converted into concise CLI messages instead of exposing unnecessary tracebacks.

Examples include:

```text
Scanner error: Config file not found
Scanner error: Config file is invalid
Authentication error
Connection error
```

For these execution failures, the scanner exits with:

```text
exit code 2
```

---

## Testing

Run the complete test suite with:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

The test suite covers:

- API health checks
- OpenAPI availability
- Login behavior
- JWT authentication
- Order endpoints
- User endpoints
- Admin endpoints
- BOLA scanner module
- BFLA scanner module
- Property authorization scanner
- JSON reporting
- Markdown reporting
- CLI error handling
- Comparative scanning
- Demo database reset behavior

---

## CI/CD

The repository includes a **GitHub Actions** pipeline.

Tests are automatically executed on:

```text
push
pull_request
```

This allows scanner functionality to be continuously validated as the project evolves.

The CI pipeline represents the first step toward integrating authorization security testing into a broader DevSecOps workflow.

---

## Portability

AuthZ Scanner is intentionally designed so that the scanner engine is not tightly coupled to the included demo APIs.

Testing another REST API primarily requires a new configuration file containing information such as:

- target base URL
- authentication endpoint
- authentication request
- token extraction path
- profile endpoint
- test identities
- BOLA rules
- BFLA rules
- property authorization rules

Authorization logic is highly dependent on application-specific business rules.

For this reason, the scanner does not attempt to fully infer authorization expectations automatically.

Instead, expected behavior is defined explicitly through configuration files.

For additional details, see:

```text
docs/configuration.md
```

A starter configuration is available at:

```text
config/example_external.yaml
```

---

## Example External Configuration

A simplified configuration may look conceptually like this:

```yaml
target:
  base_url: "http://localhost:8000"

auth:
  login_endpoint: "/login"
  token_field: "access_token"

identities:
  user_a:
    username: "userA@example.com"
    password: "password"

  user_b:
    username: "userB@example.com"
    password: "password"
```

Target-specific authorization rules can then be defined without changing the scanner engine.

---

## Security and Ethical Use

AuthZ Scanner is intended for:

- local security labs
- intentionally vulnerable applications
- systems owned by the tester
- systems where explicit authorization for security testing has been granted

Do not use the scanner against systems without permission.

The included vulnerable API exists specifically to provide a controlled environment for security testing and development.

---

## Current Limitations

The project currently has several intentional limitations:

- Authorization expectations must largely be defined manually through configuration.
- The scanner does not automatically discover complete business authorization rules.
- OpenAPI specifications are not yet used to automatically generate scanner configuration.
- The included vulnerability modules focus primarily on authorization-related API security issues.
- Some mutation-based tests can modify target application state.
- The demo environment is designed for controlled security testing rather than production deployment.

---

## Future Work

Planned improvements include:

- OpenAPI-based configuration discovery
- Automatic generation of starter scanner configuration from `/openapi.json`
- HTML security reports
- Configurable severity levels
- Docker support for the scanner and demo APIs
- Improved CI/CD security integration
- Additional API authorization test modules
- More advanced evidence correlation
- Enhanced comparison between vulnerable and remediated API versions

---

## Project Goals

AuthZ Scanner was developed to explore the intersection of:

- Backend Engineering
- API Security
- Application Security
- Security Automation
- Software Testing
- DevSecOps

The project demonstrates how authorization security tests can be represented as reusable, repeatable, and reportable automated workflows rather than only manual penetration testing steps.
